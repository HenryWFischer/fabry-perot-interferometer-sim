# fabry-perot-interferometer-sim
This project models the behavior of light in a Fabryâ€“Perot optical cavity, showing how multiple reflections between two parallel mirrors can create sharp resonance peaks. 

This experiment explores how changing the wavelength of light, cavity length, and reflectivity of the mirrors changes the resonance peaks. These results are shown on graphs relating the changing parameter to the 
transmition of light. Many different parameters within the simulation can be changed, to explore the characteristics of the interferometer, such as the angle of incident light, refractive index of the cavity 
(currently set to air), reflectivity, cavity length, and wavelength.

Future topics of exploration could be a narrowband spectral filter for single-photon wavepackets, a topic that directly applies to quantum computing since it is a method used to filter the photons 
down to a narrow linewidth so they match atomic transitions or other photons.
